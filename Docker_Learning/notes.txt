pc -> cpu or we can say processor
    -> Ram
    -> Storage

*if we want to wrk with this three thing , we need an operating system.
   -> So, OS have Karnel where have many driver
   -> And Karnel manage the above three hardware with the help of driver.
   -> for talking with OS we need software(nodejs, python, brawser).

flow
User -> software -> requesting -> Karnel -> then carnel execute the request the help of Hardwares

*** every Os take resgistry for maintain software


// For the first photo
-> first area Hardware level Vertaualaization. (expample:- VMWARE, VirtalBox, Hyper V)

//for the second photo  
-> We see HOST OS or Mother OS Who provide the vistualation os

//for the third photo
-> problem discustion , that a OS not handling different node app, that's why we need another os confiquaration , It's a problem and we need to solve.


//for photo 4
-> learned container

//for photo 5
-> docker deep dive
